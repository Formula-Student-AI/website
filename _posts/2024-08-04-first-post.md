# Pythagoras’ Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

where:

- $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs,
- $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.

## Example Code

Here’s how you might calculate the hypotenuse in Python:

```python
import math

def hypotenuse(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

print(hypotenuse(3, 4))  # Output: 5.0
```
