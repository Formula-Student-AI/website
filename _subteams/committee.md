summary: "Compute, sensors, power, mounting, reliability, and trackside diagnostics."
---

The **Hardware** team turns designs into a race-ready, reliable car. We own the compute platform, sensor suite, power delivery, wiring, thermal management, and the mechanical interfaces that let software shine on track.

## Focus areas

- **Compute & networking:** carrier/IPC selection, CAN/Ethernet, time sync (PTP), logging, storage.
- **Power & safety:** PDUs, fusing, EMI/ESD, e-stop integration, brownout resilience, protections.
- **Sensors & calibration:** camera/LiDAR/radar mounting, alignment, vibration isolation, weatherproofing.
- **Thermals & enclosures:** airflow paths, heatsinks/fans, environmental sealing (IP), dust/water ingress.
- **Wiring & robustness:** harness design, connectors, strain relief, quick-release serviceability.
- **Trackside diagnostics:** bring-up checklists, spares, failure triage, rapid component swaps.

## Practices

- **Design for reliability:** shock/vibe tolerance, derating, redundancy where it counts.
- **Serviceability:** labeled looms, modular mounts, tool-less access for fast turnaround.
- **Test early, test often:** bench rigs, soak tests, thermal cycling, on-car telemetry checks.

## Typical deliverables

- Power architecture, fusing, safety interlocks, and schematics.
- Sensor mounting kits with calibration procedures.
- Wiring harness drawings and assembly guides.
- Thermal plan and enclosure CAD.
- Trackside setup/bring-up and troubleshooting playbooks.
