# Statics  

>No matter how much everyone else messes up, we make it look good through presentation, communication, and confidence.

Statics comprises all aspects of the team. We are responsible for demonstrating the robustness of the team, and professionally communicating all our work to boards of industry judges at Silverstone. We are the face of the team at competition.
