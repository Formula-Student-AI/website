The **Web Development** team builds and maintains the digital platforms that keep Formula Student AI connected, informed, and professional. From public-facing websites to internal dashboards, we enable the rest of the team to focus on racing.

## Focus areas

- **Public website:** showcase the project, publish news, and attract sponsors, students, and supporters.
- **Telemetry & dashboards:** live race data visualization, run logs, performance analytics.
- **Internal tooling:** portals for documentation, shift scheduling, inventory, and workflows.
- **Design system:** consistent UI/UX across apps, responsive layouts, accessibility standards.
- **DevOps & infrastructure:** CI/CD pipelines, containerization, deployments, and monitoring.

## Practices

- **Fast iteration:** work closely with subteams to ship features they actually need.
- **Collaboration:** pair with design & comms for branding, content, and sponsor visibility.
- **Reliability:** apps that are secure, performant, and ready under race-day pressure.
- **Open source mindset:** reusable components, shared libraries, clear documentation.

## Typical deliverables

- Marketing site (Next.js) with dynamic content and sponsor integration.
- Sponsor/partner portal with secure document sharing.
- Internal utilities (shift planner, checklists, and ops dashboards).
- Reusable React component library with styling guidelines.
